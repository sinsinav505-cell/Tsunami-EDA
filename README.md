🌍 Earthquake & Tsunami Analysis
📘 Overview

This project analyzes global earthquake data to uncover trends, patterns, and the relationship between earthquakes and tsunamis.
Through visualizations and statistical insights, it supports better understanding of disaster risk assessment and preparedness planning.

🎯 Objectives

Identify the year with the highest number of earthquakes

Find the most frequent earthquake magnitude

Calculate the percentage of earthquakes that caused tsunamis

Determine the average number of tsunamis per year

Compare tsunami vs non-tsunami earthquakes per year

Analyze depth vs magnitude and their role in triggering tsunamis

📂 Dataset Information

File: earthquake_data_tsunami.csv

Key Columns:

Year – Year of occurrence

Month – Month of occurrence

Magnitude – Intensity of the earthquake

Depth – Depth of the earthquake (in km)

Latitude / Longitude – Geographical location

Tsunami – Indicates if a tsunami occurred (1 = Yes, 0 = No)

📊 Key Insights
📅 Year with Most Earthquakes

2015 recorded the highest number of earthquakes globally.

📏 Most Frequent Magnitude

Magnitude 6.5 occurred most often.

🌊 Earthquakes Resulting in Tsunamis

37.5% of total earthquakes led to tsunamis.

📊 Average Tsunamis per Year

On average, 30% of yearly earthquakes caused tsunamis.

⚡ Tsunami vs Non-Tsunami Earthquakes (Post-2012)

After 2012, the likelihood of an earthquake triggering a tsunami is significantly higher.

📉 Depth vs Magnitude Analysis

Red points → Earthquakes causing tsunamis (high magnitude, shallow depth)

Blue points → Non-tsunami earthquakes (wider depth and magnitude range)

📈 Visualizations Included

Histogram of earthquakes per year

Magnitude distribution over time

Correlation heatmap of numerical features

Pair plots to visualize yearly magnitude patterns

Depth vs Magnitude scatter plot (colored by tsunami occurrence)

Count plots comparing tsunami vs non-tsunami events

💡 Summary

Higher magnitude and shallow-depth earthquakes are more likely to generate tsunamis.

2015 had the peak earthquake activity globally.

The probability of tsunamis has increased notably after 2012.

Correlation heatmaps show strong links between magnitude, depth, and tsunami occurrence.
